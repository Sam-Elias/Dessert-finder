HOME MADE DESSERT APPLICATION

This is an application for folks who like to make desserts, and for folks who like to make them in Santa Barbara.

All the Santa Barbarians can now, look for this comforting food and socialize with the peers making them.

For the dessert makers, it is a chance to make some extra bucks, and of course socialize. Because socialize!

At this stage, the app has a fixed amount of features. Actually, there aren't any but we plan to add them in the future and make the site more dynamic, allowing users to push information to our servers. We don't have a server yet, ops.

Once we have a server we will let you upload all sorts of data though!

HOW TO USE THE APP

The app will list all the desserts and the places where you can get them as markers on the map. In order to search for an specific dessert type in the search box. Click on the dessert you want in order to get information about who made and how to contact them (you don't have their contact information just yet, though). You can also click on the markers to look for the information.

Look forward for more!
